# Kaggle Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects and notebooks I completed on Kaggle. Each notebook involves data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and model building using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and more.

## Projects Included

1. **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**  
   Predict survival using classification models.

2. **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**  
   Predict house prices using regression techniques.

3. **Netflix Movies and TV Shows EDA**  
   Explore trends and insights from Netflix's catalog.

4. **Heart Disease Prediction**  
   Build a model to predict the presence of heart disease.

5. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   Anomaly detection for identifying fraudulent transactions.

6. **Stroke Prediction Dataset**  
   Predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke.

7. **Iris Dataset Classification**  
   Simple classification using the famous Iris dataset.

8. **Customer Segmentation with K-Means**  
   Apply clustering techniques to group similar customers.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Notes

Each project is presented as a Jupyter notebook and is self-contained. These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of core data science skills including:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and evaluation
